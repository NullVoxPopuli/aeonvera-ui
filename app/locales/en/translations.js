      name: 'Names can mean a lot - they can also mean nothing. The owner of ÆONVERA \
        spent numerous days looking up various prefixes and suffixes to stitch together. \
        Eventually he decided to use a sort of exotic, yet ancient word ÆON - meaning "life". \
        ÆON is a good word just by itself and has a nice ring to it, especially when pronounced \
        with a long "a" sound instead of a typical "e" sound. But the owner felt that there \
        needed to be a suffix. Eventually VERA, meaning "true", was chosen so mean that ÆONVERA \
        is true to life, true to its promises, and true to its mission to help guide organizers \
        and attempt to relieve the stress that comes from organizing and mananging attendees.',
      pronounce: 'The "Æ" letter, in Modern English does not have an agreed \
        upon pronunciation. Some people pronounce it as "ee", like in "eon",\
        some pronounce it as "eh", as in "esophagus".  \
        The creator of ÆONVERA pronounces it as a long "a" sound like in "ape".\
        "Vera" is pronounced like in \
        Aloe Vera. No tricks on that one.'
